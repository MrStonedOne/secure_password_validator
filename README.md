# Secure Password Validator

Provides an Authentication module that validates passwords are secure and not common, or hacked.

Passwords are checked against the 10k most common passwords (hard coded).

Passwords are checked against the Have I Been Pwned hacked password database.

Users with insecure passwords must reset their password before they can login again.

Registration, change, and reset checking will be coming in a future update.
